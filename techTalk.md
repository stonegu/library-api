# Library API Exercise

## Intro

GraphQL is a relatively new concept from Facebook that is a query language for REST API endpoints.

The main advantage of using GraphQL are:
1. No need to create multiple API (Application Programming Interface) endpoints in an application unlike in REST where we expose multiple endpoints to retrieve data
2. Using GraphQL, we get the exact data we need or request.
3. Can get data from multiple resouces at the same time.
4. Integrating front-end applications (like mobile apps) with GraphQL are fast & responsive over REST APIâ€™s
